# tic-tac-toe
A one player tic tac toe program. 

This was taken from a class, which I am not a part of but wanted to have something to work on in my down time. The original code did not detect diagonals or perform any type of blocking. The original code is in the "original" folder for comparison.

I will probably be refactoring this more as I learn more about Java.
